  "narrative": "The core paradox deepens: he can no longer access the memory of tomorrow's disaster, yet the biological footprint of that inaccessible memory lingers, a phantom limb in his own subjective timeline. The attenuation of conscious recall, rather than decoupling him from the future catastrophe, seemed instead to render him acutely, though subconsciously, *sensitive* to its imminence. His somatosensory system registered phantom tremors, a pre-cognitive unease that lacked specific ideation. His sleep cycles became erratic, punctuated by vivid, dreamlike sequences devoid of linear narrative, yet infused with an overwhelming sense of impending disjunction. The team noted a subtle but measurable shift in his baseline physiological responses: elevated cortisol levels, persistent sympathetic nervous system activation, all indicators of acute stress without a discernible conscious trigger. The paradox had inverted; the information, once a precise memory, now manifested as a diffuse, pervasive anxiety, a signal without a source, a harbinger without a message. He was not forgetting the catastrophe; he was becoming the catastrophe's diffuse emotional resonance, a living, breathing seismograph for an event he was supposedly blind to. The question now was not whether the event would cease to exist, but whether Thorne’s deliberate obfuscation of its nature would render the world utterly unprepared, leaving them to navigate the blind echo of a disaster he alone had once remembered.",
