  "narrative": "Input: The subject, Dr. Aris Thorne, claims to remember tomorrow. Not predict it—remember it. His brain scans show retrograde amnesia for the past, but perfect synaptic firing for events that haven't happened. He calls it 'Chrono-Synaptic Displacement'. He initiates a protocol to 'forget' the impending catastrophe, believing that if he forgets it, it effectively ceases to exist in the timeline.",
