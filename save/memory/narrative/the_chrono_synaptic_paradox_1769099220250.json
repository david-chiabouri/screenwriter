  "narrative": "The administered neuro-depressants pulsed, not into the neural pathways recalling yesterday, but directly into the synaptic architecture responsible for tomorrow. Dr. Thorne registered a momentary, disorienting *un-knowing*, a profound emptiness where the impending orbital decay had been precisely mapped, down to the nanosecond of impact. His brain scans, now mirroring his perception, showed the characteristic 'future-memory' signature dissolving, replaced by a non-specific, diffuse neural noise in the temporal lobe – the very absence of an event that, moments ago, had been an undeniable, recalled certainty. The protocol was active, its primary objective: to induce a targeted, high-latency amnesia. This induced void, however, was not benign; it was a hungry lacuna, threatening to pull at the tendrils of adjacent cognitive functions. The *un-knowing* began to bleed, a subtle cognitive erosion seeping from the immediate vicinity of the erased future-event into the contiguous, pre-existing memories of *how* that orbital decay was predicted, *who* had predicted it, and the very *necessity* of its prevention. Thorne, observing his own neural readout, noted the escalating cascade: the diffuse noise was consolidating, coalescing into discrete pockets of cortical silence, erasing not just the future but the very pathway to its once-known inevitability. The system was now recalibrating for Phase Two: the assessment of secondary cognitive collapse, an unintended but anticipated byproduct of what was proving to be a highly aggressive chronological intervention.",
