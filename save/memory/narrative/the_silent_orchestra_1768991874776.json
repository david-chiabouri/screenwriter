  "narrative": "Input: Maestro Valo discovered the 'Null-Note' during a performance of Cage's 4'33\". He realized that the silence wasn't empty; it was heavy. By conducting the silence with specific gestures, he found he could make the audience feel emotions that had no name. He began to weave silence into chaos, dampening the noise of the world, until he accidentally conducted a silence so profound it erased the first row of the audience.",
