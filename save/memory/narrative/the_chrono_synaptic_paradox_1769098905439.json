  "narrative": "The decline in delta wave synchronization intensified, indicative of significant neural activity suppression within the targeted pre-frontal clusters. Concurrently, however, peripheral cortical regions, previously quiescent, exhibited a compensatory surge in gamma oscillations, a phenomenon largely unanticipated by the pre-protocol modeling. Dr. Elise Kael, lead neuro-monitor, noted a concurrent, precipitous drop in Thorne’s previously consistent galvanic skin response, a biomarker for anticipatory stress, though his primary EEG readings remained within the parameters of deep meditative states, bordering on induced coma.\n\nThe projected timeline for complete neural recalibration was T+6 hours from pulse initiation. However, at T+2.3 hours, the system registered a transient, yet pronounced, spike in theta wave amplitude originating from the parahippocampal gyrus—a region strongly implicated in spatial memory and contextual recall. This localized anomaly, while brief, suggested an unexpected re-consolidation of neural pathways, potentially re-establishing connections that the electromagnetic pulse was designed to sever. The fundamental question, articulated in Kael's internal monologue, arose: was Thorne truly forgetting the catastrophe, or was the brain merely re-routing the catastrophic 'memory' through an alternate, less accessible, neural architecture, potentially rendering the 'future' even more indelible? The shielded chamber’s internal chronometer displayed T+70 hours to the Great Convergence Event.",
