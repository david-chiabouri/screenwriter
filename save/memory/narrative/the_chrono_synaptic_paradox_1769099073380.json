  "narrative": "The attenuation of synaptic pathways within Thorne’s anterior prefrontal cortex intensified, mirroring a proportional degradation in the resolution of his precognitive data stream. Researchers noted an escalating delta wave activity concurrent with his reports of 'chronological erosion,' where the once vivid, tactile recall of Event Horizon-7 began to fracture into incoherent fragments. The specificity of the impending disaster, previously a burden of absolute certainty, transformed into a generalized anxiety, then a cognitive void. The objective, the complete deconstruction of the 'future-memory' construct, appeared to be progressing, yet the residual synaptic echoes suggested not an absence, but a re-encoding—a transformation of memory into potential, rather than its absolute obliteration. The systemic recalibration of his neural architecture commenced, a delicate process aimed at re-establishing chronological linearity within his cognitive framework. His internal monologue, previously a continuous cascade of future events, now presented as sporadic, unanchored sensory impressions, each lacking the definitive temporal marker that had once defined his paradoxical existence.",
